| 🎨 **Vanilla CSS** | Hand-crafted styles, no frameworks needed (we're old school romantics) |
| ⚡ **Vanilla JavaScript** | Pure, unfiltered, organic JS (no framework drama here) |
| 🌐 **HTML5** | The foundation of our digital love story |
| 🎭 **CSS Animations** | For those smooth, swoony effects |
| 📍 **Geolocation API** | Tracks where the love is spreading (totally not creepy) |
| 🗺️ **IP Geolocation** | Because geography is romantic? |
